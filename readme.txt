MedSyn
Objective
MedSyn uses watsonx.ai to create a GenAI powered clinical synopsis tool that extracts and presents relevant patient information in an easy-to-comprehend format. This tool saves time, reduces the risk of missing critical details, and improves patient care.


MedSyn leverages IBM's watsonx.ai to generate concise summaries of Electronic Health Records (EHR). This allows healthcare professionals to quickly understand a patient's medical history, including conditions, medications, surgical history, and lab reports.

#Prerequisites
-Before setting up MedSyn, ensure you have the following software and tools installed:
-Python 3.8 or later
-pip (Python package installer)
-An IBM Cloud account with access to watsonx.ai
-A valid IBM Cloud API key

CodeBase has not been setup completely due to issues faced in API Connectivity 
Proof Of Concept Will be Shown in Prompt Lab
